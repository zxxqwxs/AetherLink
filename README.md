# AetherLink

A decentralized social trust protocol based on Zero-Knowledge Graph algorithms for building privacy-preserving relationship networks.

## Overview

AetherLink is a privacy-focused social graph protocol that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to enable verifiable relationship attestations without revealing the underlying connection paths.

## Architecture

```
[User Wallets] → [AetherRegistry] → [GraphStorage] → [ZK Prover] → [Verifier] → [ReputationManager] → [Frontend/API]
```

## Core Components

- **Smart Contracts**: On-chain relationship storage and verification
- **ZK Circuits**: Privacy-preserving path proofs using circom/Halo2
- **Reputation Engine**: EigenTrust/GraphRank based scoring system
- **Indexing Layer**: Subgraph for queryable social graphs
- **Frontend**: Next.js + D3.js visualization

## Getting Started
